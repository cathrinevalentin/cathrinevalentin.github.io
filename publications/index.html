        <em>Online Political Influence: The Role of Groups.</em>

        <p class="small" style="margin-top:8px">
          <strong>Abstract.</strong> How does political influence through social media accounts work? Existing literature often attributes influence from social media accounts to celebrity status effects like para-social relationships and rich-get-richer network dynamics. These explanations neglect a key feature of digital spaces: the reactions of others. Online, the reactions of others are always instantly present through likes, comments, reshares, and posts. Building on research in social psychology, we argue that such online group dynamics condition the effect of political influence from social media accounts. We test this through an online survey experiment. Leveraging social media advertising for recruitment, we microtarget members of the online ingroup around Taylor Swift. 
This recruitment strategy allows us to hold selected exposure, community membership, and parasocial relationships constant, thereby enabling us to tease out how online reactions are conditioning the political influence of a parasocial relationship. By doing so, we argue that the political influence of online accounts lies with and among the followers. Social media actors might set the agenda by discussing topics they deem important, but the group dynamics among the audience drive the influence.

        <em>Do influence cascades on social media reinforce themselves or do they fizzle out?</em>

        <p class="small" style="margin-top:8px">
          <strong>Abstract.</strong> Social influence is often assumed to be self-correcting in interactive environments because, in such settings, individuals who are exposed to a particular group reaction (e.g., a set of positive or negative comments) may later contribute to that same environment by leaving their own reactions. Therefore, unless subsequent contributions are equally strong or stronger, the overall tone of the comment section will soften over time. Under this logic, sustained backlash should occur only when early negative reactions are so powerful that later contributions remain at least as extreme as what individuals were exposed to. I argue that this dynamic may break down under selective expression, a defining feature of social media environments. Here, engagement is skewed toward a small minority of users with extreme attitudes who consistently express themselves, while the remaining majority remains silent unless the visible norm aligns with their private views. I formalize this intuition in a minimal agent-based model that incorporates heterogeneous thresholds for public expression. I hypothesize that even when most individuals privately support a message, early negative reactions can dominate the visible comment climate, suppress corrective counter-speech, and generate self-reinforcing backlash dynamics.
